     		<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
     		<p>Group by is used for organizing attributes containing aggregate functions. When using a GROUP BY statement there
     		must be at least one aggregate attribute in the SELECT statement and it must be grouped by all non-aggregate attributes. The above
     		select statement shows a basic GROUP BY statement which gives us condensed information about certian product types 
     		in the table tblProduct</p>
     		<h2>List of Aggregate Functions</h2>

     			<span>MAX() /* Gives the largest value for all values associated with an attribute. Can be used with datetime fields.*/</span>

     			<span>SUM() /* Gives the total of all rows of a given attribute added together.*/</span>
     			<span>COUNT() /* Counts the number of rows associated with a given column. Use DISTINCT keyword for unique rows.*/</span>

     		<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
     		<p>Sometimes GROUP BY alone fails us when we want just one data point with non-aggregate and aggregate information. In the above example,
     		I want the productID of the order line which cost the most determined as (qtyOrdered * price). This can only be done with a sub-query where
     		we push our aggregate function calls to the sub-query. The best process for building a function of this variety comes from creating the subquery first and determining what
     		WHERE comparaision will give us the data we are looking for.</p>

			</pre>
			<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
			<p>We can think of a view as a variable which holds the table returned from a select query. We can generally use views to
			simplify sub quieries especially when they start to get more complex. Views can also save us some work by giving us a place
			to store result tables we frequently use which are complicated or tedious to type. The above view holds a self join with
			information about employees and thier managers. Self joins can be hard sometimes so we write it once and be done?</p>
